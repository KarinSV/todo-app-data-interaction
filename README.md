# Project description

This is a school project for a course on data interaction. In this course, I built a simple ToDo app using the MERN stack.

__MERN__ is a full-stack web development framework composed of four technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

- `MongoDB` is a document-oriented, NoSQL database used to store your app data.
- `Express.js` is a framework layered on top of Node.js used to build the backend of a site using Node.js functions and structures. Since Node.js was not developed to make websites but rather to run JavaScript on a machine, Express.js was developed.
- `React` is a library created by Facebook that is used to build UI components which create the user interface of a single page web application.
- `Node.js` is a JavaScript runtime environment that provides you with the ability to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

In my project, you can see how to pass data, create states, and connect the front-end to the back-end by fetching the data from the back-end.
